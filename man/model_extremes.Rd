\title{Model typical behaviour and Estimate Lower Extreme Threshold}
\usage{
model_extremes(
  full_data,
  time_col,
  typical_start,
  typical_end,
  response,
  tail_prob = 0.05,
  t_method = c("evd", "boxplot")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_data}{A tsibble object containing at least a time index column
a response variable to be modeled.}

\item{time_col}{Name of the time index column.}

\item{typical_start}{Start date-time (character or POSIXct) defining the beginning
of the typical observation window used for model fitting.}

\item{typical_end}{End date-time (character or POSIXct) defining the end
of the typical observation window.}

\item{response}{The response variable to model, passed as an unquoted column name.}

\item{tail_prob}{Numeric value (default = 0.05). Tail probability used for defining
the lower extreme threshold when `t_method = "evd"`.}

\item{t_method}{Character string indicating the threshold estimation method.
Options are:
\itemize{
  \item `"evd"` — estimates the threshold using the Generalized Pareto Distribution.
  \item `"boxplot"` — uses the boxplot rule (1.5 × IQR below Q1) to identify lower extremes.
}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{model}{The fitted ARIMA model object.}
  \item{lower_limit}{The estimated lower extreme threshold.}
  \item{threshold_method}{The threshold estimation method used (`"evd"` or `"boxplot"`).}
  \item{fitted_subset}{The subset of the time series used for model fitting.}
  \item{full_data}{The original full dataset provided.}
  \item{response}{The response variable name.}
}
}
\description{
Fits an ARIMA model on a subset of the time series representing "typical" behavior
and estimates a lower extreme threshold based on either Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) or a boxplot-based approach.
}
\details{
The function first subsets the input time series between `typical_start` and `typical_end`
to capture non-extreme, representative behavior. An ARIMA model is automatically fitted
using the `fable` framework, and residuals are extracted.

Depending on the chosen `t_method`, the lower extreme threshold is estimated:
\itemize{
  \item For `"evd"` — the Generalized Pareto Distribution is fitted to the lower tail
        of residuals using \code{fpot()} from the \pkg{evd} package.
  \item For `"boxplot"` — the lower whisker (Q1 − 1.5 × IQR) is used as the threshold.
