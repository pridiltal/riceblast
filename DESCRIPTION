Description: The riceblast package provides data and tools for forecasting rice blast disease outbreaks using weather-based parameters. It combines climate variables (such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall)  with knowledge of disease development to build predictive models and early warning systems. The package helps researchers, agronomists, and policymakers understand and anticipate disease risks, supporting sustainable management strategies to reduce crop losses and improve food security.
