#' riceblast: Weather-Based Blast Disease Forecasting and Early Warning System
#' @description The riceblast package provides data and tools for forecasting
#' rice blast disease outbreaks using weather-based parameters. It combines
#' climate variables (such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall) with
#' knowledge of disease development to build predictive models and early
#' warning systems. The package helps researchers, agronomists, and
#' policymakers understand and anticipate disease risks, supporting
#' sustainable management strategies to reduce crop losses and improve food security.
