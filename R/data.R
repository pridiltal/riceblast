#' Field 1 data: Climate and rice blast observations from Kilinochchi, Sri Lanka
#'
#' This dataset contains historical climate and rice blast disease observations
#' for Field 1 located in Kilinochchi, Sri Lanka (latitude 9.385680, longitude 80.538083).
#' At this site, planting occurred on 2020-11-15, and the disease was observed on 2021-02-12.
#' The data were collected from the Copernicus EU Earth Observation Program (https://www.copernicus.eu/en),
#' which integrates satellite and ground-based information to provide global climate coverage,
#' and supplemented with rice blast disease records obtained from the Department of Agriculture,
#' Sri Lanka. Field visits were conducted during the 2020/2021 “Maha” season when blast
#' outbreaks were reported. Farmers observed that under favorable environmental conditions,
#' complete field infection occurred within 24–48 hours after the appearance of initial symptoms
