The goal of the `riceblast` R package is to provides data and tools for forecasting
rice blast disease outbreaks using weather-based parameters. It combines
climate variables (such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall) with
knowledge of disease development to build predictive models and early
warning systems. The package helps researchers, agronomists, and
policymakers understand and anticipate disease risks, supporting
sustainable management strategies to reduce crop losses and improve food
security.

## Installation

You can install the development version of riceblast from [GitHub](https://github.com/pridiltal/riceblast) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("pridiltal/riceblast")
```

## Proposed framework

The following figure summarizes the proposed framework for climate-based blast disease monitoring, comprising two primary phases: an off-line phase and an on-line phase. In the off-line phase, historical climate data characterizing typical behaviour are preprocessed, and an automated model selection procedure is employed to identify the optimal univariate model for a given dataset, which are subsequently fitted to the data. Residuals from these models are then analyzed to estimate field-specific anomalous thresholds using Extreme Value Theory (EVT), providing reference points for the detection of potential disease outbreaks. In the on-line phase, incoming climate data from the test window undergoes preprocessing and forecast generation. Forecast errors are evaluated against the previously determined anomalous thresholds to classify observations as either typical or indicative of a blast alert. This two-phase approach enables both data-driven model calibration and real-time disease risk assessment.

## Example


This is an example dataset available in the riceblast package. For more examples, please refer to the package vignettes.


```{r example, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(riceblast)
head(field1)
```


The following example demonstrates the detection of unusually low values (lower extremes) in a daily time series, using a synthetic dataset processed through the `riceblast` workflow. We first fit a model on an initial “typical” period to estimate the lower extreme threshold and then test whether future observations fall below that threshold. The generated plots visualize both the detected extremes and the corresponding forecast errors.

```{r}
# Create a sample daily time series dataset 
data <- tsibble::tsibble(
  date = seq.Date(as.Date("2020-01-01"), as.Date("2020-12-31"), by = "day"),
  value = c(rnorm(300), rnorm(66, -3)),
  index = date
)


# Fit the model to estimate the lower extreme threshold using a “typical” period
result <- model_extremes_uni(
  full_data = data,
  time_col = date,
  typical_start = "2020-01-01",
  typical_end = "2020-08-30",
  response = value,
  thr_prob_fit = 0.1,
  t_method = "boxplot"
)

# Prepare a test dataset
test_data <- data |>
  dplyr::filter(date > as.Date("2020-06-30")) |>
  dplyr::select(date, value) |>
  tsibble::as_tsibble(index = date)

# Evaluate future values against the learned extreme threshold
test_result <- riceblast::test_extremes_uni(result, test_data = test_data, h = 200)

# # Generate and view plots for extremes and errors
plots <- plot_extreme_analysis_uni(test_result)

# Visualize future forecasts relative to the typical historical behaviour
plots$main_plot

# Visualize detected extremes using the residual and forecast error plots
plots$error_plot
```


## Funding

This R package was developed under the interdisciplinary project titled “Weather-based Blast Disease Forecasting and Early Warning Systems for Climate Risk Adaptation”, funded through the National Agricultural Research Plan (NARP) initiative of the Sri Lanka Council for Agricultural Research Policy (SLCARP) -2024.
